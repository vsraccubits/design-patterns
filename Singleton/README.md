# Singleton

- Singleton is a design pattern for ensuring a single instance of a class with global access.
- Ensure that a class has just a single instance.
- Provide a global access point to that instance.
- The singleton object is initialized only when it’s requested for the first time.
- The pattern requires special treatment in a multithreading environment so that multiple threads won’t create a singleton object several times
